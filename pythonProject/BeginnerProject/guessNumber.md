# Number Guessing Game (Deadline: January 30 11:59PM, 2021):

This project also uses the random module in Python. The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. It needs to check the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and then compare the numbers.
Concepts to keep in mind:
```
Random function
Variables
Integers
Input/Output
Print
While loops
If/Else statements
```

## Requirement:

- User inputs the **lower bound** and **upper bound** of the range.
- User input the maximum number of guesses.
- The program generates a random integer between the range.
- For repetitive guessing, a while loop will be initialized.
- If the user guessed a number which is greater than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too high“
- If the user guessed a number which is smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too small”
- If the user guessed within the maximum number of guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations! ” Output.
- If the user didn’t guess the integer with the maximum number of guesses, he/she will get “Better Luck Next Time!” output.
