# Pattern Printer (Deadline: January 16 12:00PM, 2021:

In Python, pattern printing programs are a great way to test nested loop designing skills. Essentially, all you have to do is print text in such a way, using loops, that they resemble symmetrical patterns.

## Step 1:
Now, if a user enters the number 5, you need to print five rows of the following Half Pyramid pattern. 
For example, a half pyramid pattern looks like this:

```
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5 
```

## Step 2:
You can try other patterns as well (at least two pattern) and create a menu-based program that asks the users which pattern they want to print. For instance like the following menu:

```
----------Pattern Printer Menu----------
1. Print Half Pyramid of Number
2. Print Inverted Half Pyramid of Number
3. Print Half Pyramid of Number
4. Print Inverted full pyramid of Number
